^1. Create duplicate of https://cdainterview.com
  - Only Home Page and Contact Us Page

^2. Make the following accessible in panel:
  >- Easy way to make changes
  >- Simple switch to turn any page into "No-index" 
    so it's not crawled by search engines
  >- Easy to change text
  >- Easy to style text (bold, italics, strikethrough,
    create links, center text, and turn text to H1, H2, H3)
  >- Include a space for each page to include meta title and meta description
  >- Include a space in the panel to include Facebook advertising pixel
    and a seperate section to include Google analytics tag - these
    should be global - i.e. including the code, will integrate the tags
    across all existing AND future pages. (Will be tested by including
    actual tags in the area you indicate in the panel to make sure they are functional)
  >- Create a space in the panel for the contact form to link any email address to the 
    contact form as we will be testing the functionality.
